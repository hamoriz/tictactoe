The goal of the case is to create an implementation of the Player interface. 
Read the JavaDoc carefully. Keep in mind that:

* We are not so much looking for a solution that performs very fast. If your 
  implementation finds the best solution within a second, that is good enough.
  
* We are interested in the readability and maintainability of your code.

* We are only interested in an implementation for the Player interface. We do 
  for instance not ask for an app that can interact with other (human) 
  players, nor do we expect any kind of GUI. Your solution might of course 
  require more files (Java types), but be careful not to over-engineer your 
  solution.
  
* You are not allowed to change existing code, i.e. do not change existing files.
